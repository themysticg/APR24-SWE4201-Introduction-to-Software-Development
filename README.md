## Portfolio Item 1: Python Student Registration System
This module contains functions for a student registration system, where student details are stored, retrieved, and updated. Key features include:
- **Data Structure Implementation**: A dictionary to manage student details.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures valid data entry and retrieval.
- **Functionality**:
  - Add new students.
  - Retrieve student details.
  - Handle incorrect inputs gracefully.

### How to Use
1. Run `student_registration.py`.
2. Follow prompts to add or retrieve students by name or ID.

### Files Required
- `student_registration.py`: Main Python script for the registration system.

---

## Portfolio Item 2: Python Structure Display
This item displays various Python structures.
- **Core Structures**:
  - List
  - Dictionary
  - Tuple

### How to Use
1. Run `structure_display.py`.
2. The script will display the structures as outlined in the assignment.

## Portfolio Item 3: Java Student Record System
A Java program simulating a student record system to manage and update student details.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Uses classes for students, courses, and departments.
- **Functionality**:
  - Add and retrieve student details.
  - Update course information.
  - Implements error handling.
- **Class Diagram**: Provided in the project documentation for reference.

### How to Use
1. Compile the Java files: `javac StudentRecordSystem.java`.
2. Run with `java StudentRecordSystem`.
3. Follow on-screen options to add or update student records.

### Files Required
- `StudentRecordSystem.java`: Main Java script.

## Testing
Each item includes systematic testing to validate:
- Correct functionality (adding, retrieving, updating records).
- Proper handling of incorrect inputs.
- Ensuring program stability.

---

## Conclusion and Reflection
The portfolio showcases a progressive understanding of programming constructs, testing, and error handling, highlighting the development of technical and problem-solving skills.
